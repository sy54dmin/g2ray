# Install & Upgrade

```
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaxilu/x-ui/master/install.sh)
```

## Manual installation & upgrade

1. First download the latest compressed package from https://github.com/vaxilu/x-ui/releases, generally choose `amd64` architecture
2. Then upload the compressed package to the `/root/` directory of the server, and use the `root` user to log in to the server

> If your server cpu architecture is not `amd64`, replace `amd64` in the command with other architectures

```
cd /root/
rm x-ui/ /usr/local/x-ui/ /usr/bin/x-ui -rf
tar zxvf x-ui-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x x-ui/x-ui x-ui/bin/xray-linux-* x-ui/x-ui.sh
cp x-ui/x-ui.sh /usr/bin/x-ui
cp -f x-ui/x-ui.service /etc/systemd/system/
mv x-ui/ /usr/local/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable x-ui
systemctl restart x-ui
```

## SSL certificate application

> This function and tutorial are provided by [FranzKafkaYu](https://github.com/FranzKafkaYu)

The script has a built-in SSL certificate application function. To use this script to apply for a certificate, the following conditions must be met:

- Know the Cloudflare registered email address
- Know Cloudflare Global API Key
- The domain name has been resolved to the current server through cloudflare

How to get Cloudflare Global API Key:

     ![](media/d13ffd6a73f938d1037d0708e31433bf.png)

When using it, you only need to enter `domain name`, `email`, `API KEY`, the schematic diagram is as follows:

Precautions:

- The script uses the DNS API for certificate requests
- Use Let'sEncrypt as the CA party by default
- The certificate installation directory is the /root/cert directory
- The certificates applied for by this script are all wild domain name certificates

## Tg robot use (under development, temporarily unavailable)

> This function and tutorial are provided by [FranzKafkaYu](https://github.com/FranzKafkaYu)

X-UI supports daily traffic notification, panel login reminder and other functions through Tg robot. To use Tg robot, you need to apply for it yourself
For specific application tutorials, please refer to [Blog Link] (https://coderfan.net/how-to-use-telegram-bot-to-alarm-you-when-someone-login-into-your-vps.html)
Instructions for use: Set robot-related parameters in the background of the panel, including

- Tg Robot Token
- Tg Bot ChatId
- Tg robot cycle running time, using crontab syntax

Reference syntax:
- 30 * * * * * //Notify on the 30th of every minute
- @hourly // hourly notification
- @daily //Notification every day (0:00 AM)
- @every 8h // notify every 8 hours

TG notification content:
- Node traffic usage
- Panel login reminder
- Node expiration reminder
- Traffic warning reminder

More functions are planned...
